# These tests implicitly test that Stan and JAGS give similar results

# Need to allow room for error. The book states that 200 samples were taken from
# the posterior distributions, so tail quantiles will be variable. We could find
# an alternative version online, but that might be subject to change with
# different builds of Stan. Presumably the authors checked the Stan output against
# the printed version that comes from other software (presumably WinBUGS).

# Compare with a published version: BDA 3rd Ed., page 123
